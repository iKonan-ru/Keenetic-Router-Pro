An advanced Home Assistant integration for Keenetic routers. Provides mesh network management, VPN control, device tracking, traffic monitoring, firmware updates, per-device bandwidth limiting, 4G/LTE data-usage tracking, and more.

## 🌟 Features

### 📡 Real Time Device Tracking

* Real-time device status via **ICMP Ping**. You don't need to wait Keenetic's update time for device tracking. This integration pings the devices you selected every 3 seconds.
* Selectable client list
* 3-second update interval
* Automatic updates on IP address changes
* **Cross-subnet fallback** *(optional, off by default)* — for devices on isolated sub-networks (guest VLANs, IoT subnets) that Home Assistant can't ping directly, an opt-in toggle uses the router's own view of connected devices instead of ping. Flat-LAN setups see no change.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **If Apple iOS devices are registered with client name including 'apple', 'iphone' or 'ipad' then they will NOT be pinged every 3 seconds. Instead, they will sync with the status on the Router's interface. This is because they go into Deep Sleep mode and disable WiFi connection even when they are connected to WiFi.**

### 🔗 Mesh Network Management

* Status of all extenders/repeaters (binary sensors)
* Separate **reboot button** for each mesh node
* CPU, RAM, and uptime information per node
* Firmware version sensor for each node
* **Firmware update entity** with update-available detection
* Number of connected clients (associations) per node
* **Traffic monitoring** per node (WiFi 2.4GHz/5GHz, LAN, WAN RX/TX)
* **WiFi radio temperature** per node (2.4GHz / 5GHz)
* **USB storage** detection on mesh nodes

### 🔄 Firmware Updates

* **Update entity** for the main router (with install + progress support)
* **Update entity** for each mesh node (with install support)
* Firmware version sensor (current version, channel, architecture details)
* Binary sensor for update availability

### 🔐 VPN Management

* Enable/disable WireGuard profiles (switch)
* OpenVPN, IPsec, L2TP, PPTP support
* VPN uptime, RX/TX sensors
* **IPsec site-to-site tunnels** appear as their own sub-devices with connection state, IKE phase, byte counters, and throughput

### 📶 WiFi Control

* Enable/disable switch for each SSID
* Guest WiFi control
* **Multi-SSID setups** with bridged networks are now correctly labeled — a 2.4 GHz `MyNetwork` and a 5 GHz `MyNetwork_5G` on the same bridge each show with their real SSID

### 🌐 WAN Status (per uplink)

Each uplink (PPPoE, GigabitEthernet, USB LTE, WireGuard-as-WAN, etc.) appears as its own sub-device with:

* Real **WAN IP address** (PPPoE supported)
* **3-state connection status**: `connected` / `link_up` / `down`
* **Provider name**, priority **role**, underlying **interface**
* **Uptime** (per uplink), **RX/TX bytes**, live **RX/TX throughput**
* "Connected" and "Enabled" binary sensors

### 📊 4G / LTE Data Usage *(new)*

For routers with a USB cellular modem (UsbLte / UsbModem / UsbQmi) and the **Data Usage & Limit** feature enabled in the Keenetic web UI:

* **Data Used** — month-to-date GB, hooked into HA long-term statistics
* **Data Remaining** — GB until quota is hit
* **Data Limit** / **Data Threshold** — configured cap and warning level
* **Days Until Reset** — countdown to monthly counter rollover
* **Quota Usage** — current usage as % of limit, updated locally
* **Data Limit Exceeded** / **Data Threshold Exceeded** — automatic alarm binary sensors

### 📶 LTE Cellular Telemetry *(new)*

For LTE WANs, an additional diagnostic block:

* **Operator** (carrier name)
* **Technology** (LTE / 5G / 4G / 3G / 2G)
* **Signal Level** (0–5 bars)
* **RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, CINR** (signal quality metrics)
* **Band**, **Roaming** status, **Modem Temperature**
* **Connection State**, **APN** (APN disabled by default — opt-in)

### 🎛️ Per-Device Bandwidth Limiting *(new)*

For each tracked client, two new controls:

* **Bandwidth Limit** — a number entity (slider + direct entry) that caps the device's speed via the router's `traffic-shape` feature. Default range 0–100 000 kbit/s (≈100 Mbit/s); higher values supported via direct entry.
* **Clear Bandwidth Limit** — a one-tap button to remove the cap entirely.
* Limits persist across reboots (running config is saved).
* Whatever you set here also syncs with the Keenetic web UI.

### 📊 Traffic & Diagnostics

* **WiFi 2.4GHz / 5GHz** RX/TX traffic (GB)
* **LAN / WAN** RX/TX traffic (GB)
* **WiFi radio temperature** (2.4GHz / 5GHz)
* Active connections count
* USB storage detection
* **DNS Proxy** health + failed-request counter *(when supported)*
* **IPsec VICI** status + out-of-memory alarm *(when supported)*
* Sensors no longer report NaN / infinity / >100 % values; uptime sensors work correctly with HA's long-term statistics

### 🔌 Port Monitoring

* **Physical port status** for the main router and all mesh nodes
* Link state (up/down), speed (100/1000 Mbps), and duplex mode per port
* Includes LAN ports, WAN/ISP port, and SFP port

### 📱 Wi-Fi QR Code

* **Scannable QR code** image entity for each Wi-Fi network
* Scan with any phone camera to **connect automatically** — no manual password entry needed
* **Per-SSID QR codes** — if you have more than the standard main+guest networks, each additional SSID gets its own QR entity named after it
* QR code updates automatically when SSID or password changes

### 👥 Client Management

* Number of connected / disconnected devices
* **Connection Policy selection** (per client) — Default, VPN, No VPN, Smart Home, custom policies, or Deny (block internet)
* **Bandwidth Limit** (per client) — speed cap with one-tap clear button (see above)
* **Event trigger** when a new device connects

### 🔘 Buttons

* Router reboot
* Mesh node reboot (separate for each node)
* Clear Bandwidth Limit (per tracked client)

### 🔒 Security & Privacy *(new)*

* Password fields properly masked (dots, not plain text) in all setup forms
* Credentials never appear in log messages, error tracebacks, or `__repr__` output
* **Diagnostics export** (Settings → ⋮ → Download diagnostics) automatically redacts router host, MAC addresses, IPs, SSIDs, WiFi passwords, IMSI/IMEI/ICCID, and per-client policy tables — safe to attach to GitHub issues
* CLI arguments validated against an allowlist before reaching the router
* A `SECURITY.md` file ships with the integration explaining the protection model

### 🔧 Reauth & Reconfigure *(new)*

* **Reauth flow** — if you change the router's admin password, HA prompts you to re-enter credentials in place. No more deleting and re-adding the integration.
* **Reconfigure flow** — change router IP, port, SSL setting, or username at any time via **Settings → Devices & Services → Keenetic Router Pro → Reconfigure**. All entity history and dashboard cards stay intact.

## 📦 Installation

### Via HACS

1. Search for "Keenetic Router Pro" and install
2. Restart Home Assistant

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Web management interface must be enabled on the router

### 2. 🔒 Security, Firewall & Port Forwarding

To use this integration **securely**, it is strongly recommended to configure **Firewall rules** and **Port Forwarding** properly on your Keenetic router. This section explains *why* it matters and *how* to do it.

### 3. ⚠️ Why Firewall Configuration Is Important

* Home Assistant communicates with the router via its **web management API**
* Exposing router services directly to the internet **without restrictions** is a security risk
* Proper firewall rules ensure:
  * Only trusted devices (Home Assistant) can access the router
  * No unintended WAN access to router management services

Think of the firewall as a bouncer with a clipboard. Only invited guests get in.

### 4. 🔌 Port Forwarding

#### How to Configure Port Forwarding
1. Enable UPnP if it is not
2. Go to **Internet > Port forwarding**
3. Add a new rule:

| Setting       | Value                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Service       | Home Assistant Router API          |
| Protocol      | TCP                                |
| External Port | `100`                              |
| Internal IP   | Router LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.1.1`) |
| Internal Port | `79`                               |

![image1](images/pp.png)

🚫 **Never expose port 80/443 to WAN without firewall rules**

---

### 5. 🛡️ Firewall Rules (Recommended & Safe)

Use **Firewall rules** to restrict access.

#### Recommended Firewall Setup

1. Go to **Network Rules > Firewall**
2. Create a new rule for your **PPPoE** connection:

| Option      | Value                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Direction   | Input                                   |
| Source      | Home Assistant IP (e.g. `192.168.1.50`) |
| Destination | Router                                  |
| Service     | Custom port                             |
| Action      | Allow                                   |

3. Create a second rule:

| Option      | Value        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Direction   | Input        |
| Source      | Any          |
| Destination | Router       |
| Service     | Custom port  |
| Action      | Deny         |

✅ Ensure **only Home Assistant** can talk to the router API.

### 6. Add the Integration

Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > **Keenetic Router Pro**

### 7. Connection Details

| Field              | Description                                                      | Example       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Host               | Router IP address                                                | `192.168.1.1` |
| Port               | Web interface port                                               | `100`         |
| Username           | Admin username                                                   | `admin`       |
| Password           | Admin password (masked input)                                    | `********`    |
| Use Challenge Auth | Enable for newer models (e.g. Hero) that use NDW2 authentication | `off`         |

> [!NOTE]
> **Use Challenge Auth** is required for newer Keenetic models such as the **Hero** series that use NDW2 challenge-response authentication instead of Basic Auth. If the integration fails to connect on a newer model, try enabling this option. Older models should leave it disabled.

### 8. Select Devices for Tracking and Other Device based managements

During setup (and later via the integration's **Configure** option), you can:

* Choose which devices should be monitored via ping
* Enable **Cross-subnet fallback** — turn this on if some of your tracked devices live on an isolated sub-network that Home Assistant can't ping directly (guest VLAN, IoT subnet, etc.). The integration will fall back to the router's own view of those devices' connection state. Leave off for a typical flat LAN.

### 9. Changed your router password or IP later?

You don't need to remove and re-add the integration.

* **Password changed:** Home Assistant will surface a reauth prompt automatically — click it, enter the new password, you're done.
* **IP / port / SSL changed:** Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Keenetic Router Pro → Reconfigure** and update the values. Entity history, dashboard cards, and automations all stay intact.

> Not sure which auth method your router uses? Try **Basic Auth** first (default). If the connection fails, switch to **Challenge Auth**.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Error

1. Verify router IP address and port
2. Verify username and password
3. Ensure the web interface is enabled on the router
4. If you have a newer model (e.g. **Hero**), enable **Use Challenge Auth** in the integration settings and try again
5. If your password changed recently, look for a reauth prompt in **Settings → Devices & Services** instead of removing the integration

### Entities Not Appearing

1. Restart Home Assistant
2. Remove and re-add the integration *(should rarely be needed — reconfigure flow handles most IP/port changes)*

### Ping Not Working

* Home Assistant must have permission for ICMP ping
* Docker installations may require `network_mode: host`
* If some devices live on a different subnet (guest VLAN, IoT subnet) that HA can't ping directly, turn on **Cross-subnet fallback** in the integration's options — those devices will use the router's view of their state instead

### WAN Status Shows `link_up` Instead of `connected`

* This means the physical link is up but no IP address was assigned
* Check your ISP connection or PPPoE credentials
* The sensor will change to `connected` once an IP is obtained

### Mesh Node Sensors Missing

* Mesh diagnostics require direct RCI access to each node's IP
* Ensure mesh nodes are connected and reachable from Home Assistant
* Nodes using different credentials than the controller will not report diagnostics

### Wi-Fi QR Code Says "Open Network" / Phone Won't Connect

* Affected v1.8.0 only; fixed in v1.8.1 and later. Update to the latest release and restart Home Assistant — the QR will refresh on the next coordinator tick.

### LTE Data Usage Sensors Missing

* These only appear when the router's **Data Usage & Limit** feature is turned on for that cellular interface in the Keenetic web UI (Internet → corresponding modem → Data Usage section)
* Without it enabled, the cellular telemetry sensors (operator, signal, technology, etc.) still appear, but data-usage sensors stay hidden because there's nothing for them to read

### Bandwidth Limit Slider Shows Error When Cleared

* Home Assistant's number entity refuses an empty input value — type `0` to clear, or use the dedicated **Clear Bandwidth Limit** button next to the slider
